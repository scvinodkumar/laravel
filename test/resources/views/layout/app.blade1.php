FICO Update profile issue:
--------------------------

1. Records having drupal_uid has either 0 or NULL
2. Records having both email and fico_webusernm as NULL
3. 


Reason:
-------
1. We are creating records with updating same email id to fico_webusernm field. Since it will be different for many users. 
2. Sample form created created many issues. It overwrite all the current form data to all existing data which matches condition.
3. There are many issues which exists already in the database, may be but no reason identified so far. Since FICO also having same type of data stored in their database.
